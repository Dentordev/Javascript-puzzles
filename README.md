# Javascript Puzzles
Javascript or obfuscated/sophisticated javascript payloads found out in the wild that are hard to simulate without a webdriver.
Normally these are difficult to solve because they require a lot of things to make them work. 

Sometimes the Javascript/HTML5 uses Cryptography or the Closure Compiler. Solving and cracking these scripts without a webdriver is what I demand.
Anytime I find a peice of Javascript that is too difficult to solve such as google-lens or another site I am dumping it here to see if anybody wants to try and have a crack at it.

Good Luck :)
